# Space Llamas

Experimenting with combining a Nordic Thingy - via Web Bluetooth - and a Virtual Reality scene - built with Babylon.js.

We didn't end up finishing this intended space-based llama-featuring game, but it led to our later [WebXR + Web Bluetooth demo](https://github.com/diekus/webxr-bt) which we [presented at Heapcon and GDG DevFest in 2018](https://peteroshaughnessy.com/talks/).

Requires a web browser that supports Web Bluetooth.
